What to do when the RPi sucessfully sniffs packets off an Arduino?

Some ideas:
- manipulate the packets to act on behalf of the Arduino
- scan the packets for important information (this doesn't have to be done on the Rpi)

Main selling point of the RPi is that it's small and can be hidden easily
-> It needs to be controllable remotely or there isn't much point to the entire project

First idea is to make a simple Django website that the RPi dumps it's sniffed packets to (reason for Django is just that I have SOME experience with it)
Need to find a way for the website to give instructions to the RPi effectively (seems like the Rpi would easily be able to contact the website but not vice versa)
Maybe having the Rpi constantly polling the website for new instructions actually is feasable, depends on the computing power of the RPi



For this meeting:

Ask when the deadline is
Ask if this plan is enough
